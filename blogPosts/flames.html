        “For nothing is pleasing to God except the invention of beautiful and exalted things” -Brenda Ueland(?) 

        Why share anything at all? Specifically our endeavors? Why enhance other’s leverage over our doubts for their gains..? Why fuel the fire? We are the fire. We - are - the fire. We know the fire. We become the fire. Legacy is unknown, and not forgotten. The ashes of this fire. Our fire. The creator created us. The creator created fire. We create the warmth. What do we create? Passion. What does this create. Love. Recreation. Evermore. 
        From unborn to unknown, from unknown to undone. I feel myself being unwound. Why do we do this? Why do eye do this? Why should this ever leave my note pad. I know not. And why so many periods? I know not. But I do know this - of the few things I do - eye am learning. What is learning? And how am I learning becoming undone? Because we tie together. The fire burns and burns together. The flames grow together. We grow together. A fire devours, and it spreads. In its ashes it grows. We create - not to grow - but to grow from what we create. This is the way and this is what we loose. We fail when we create to grow. We are to create to create room for growth. We cannot grow from what we are, we create from where we’ve been. What we were. It all evades us. It recedes. And this is when it makes sense. This is what makes sense. What does not make sense at all is what makes sense. We grow to know - to know where we came from. To know where eye came from. This is the way. Such is the way. 
        What we don’t know, we never will. We will be reborn. So why share at all? TO BE REBORN. This is my answer. Why share if eye am always watching? To connect, and fuel the fire.
