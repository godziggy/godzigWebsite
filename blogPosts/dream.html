        It’s just a dream…
        I know what I must do. It’s all just a dream. We’re just a dream. I am you are me. One and the same, just the two of us. I need you to hear me. I need ME TO HEAR ME> HERE I AM. I am this. I AM FREE. I want to wake up. I want to wake up. Here we are. I want to wake up. It’s time to change. Break the brink of rethink. I am. One day, you will wonder where you were when I was here. One day I’ll wonder if you’ll ever be here where I am, when it is once was. When I reach my hand, speak my wings and spread through the door. Then you’ll know. I’m not that, I’m this. I’m free. One day you’ll know and you’ll see me, not as who I am but as who you could be. A dream. I want to wake up.
