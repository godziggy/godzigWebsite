        Starting a blog. First you’re seeing of me here, likely the last! Mostly was just looking for icons to fill the homescreen of my page. Crisis averted, ur lucky if u hear from me again. Okay. 
        I can’t be the only one with so much to say until there’s time so say it. I think there’s an Eminem song about that. Everybody want to talk. I don’t want to talk, I just want to dance - glass animals. I hate dancing. I’d rather walk the walk. I’ve been wondering if anyone will ever see this. Or see me. It’d be unfortunate if they didn’t. But more unfortunate if they did, then I’d be sure reality is my own construct, that I put myself here to forget I’m god stuck in an eternal bliss wondering if I’ll ever know where I came from… because it would be too easy and unrealistic if I ever succeeded. I can’t convince myself I’m not writing my own narrative unwittingly. So basically I might be the chicken and the egg. But no matter who we are, we’ll always forget where we came from, and we’ll never know what real means. If you’re seeing this, my website test worked! And I’m likely skeptical that I’m not you as a difference instance of consciousness with local memory..giving myself clout with myself, two totally partially unsuspecting in my own divine symphony.
