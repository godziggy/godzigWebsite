      <p class="entries" style="padding-left: 100px;">
	As a human, otherwise known as a host of the viruses known as ideas, here I am sat. Spreading the contagion otherwise driving me mad. Delirious, sick, in vain. Where they begin, we may never know, or how they appear we may never understand. Regardless it is only out of self respect for the patient to seek treatment. Combined with the ego, ailments complete the match made in heaven.

The yin and the yang speak louder than words. Similar to that of describing what it feels to be ‘high’. Or to describe just about anything you can reckon. Living is more locally bound than we hope or think. And yet the buried truth, the uniting force pulling all the so seeming individual levers, is the reality. We are of a whole. And your local instance will only understand this when it can truly bear observing the whole at once. A deletion of the self. When the way is followed narrowly and precisely to the end, you find you understand everything broadly. I understand the Jack of all trades is master of none, and often forgotten better than master of one, but perhaps what we were all missing is a master of one becomes the Jack of all trades.

It’s so obvious. And so duh. And yet so taken for granted. Or so obvious it becomes non obvious, not even recognized or acknowledged as the substrate and background. The forrest through the trees. Or something along those lines. I am a proponent of individual interpretation. Suffice it to say, through this lens it can become blatantly apparent the most important point of focus for the conscious would be pursuit of the fullest perception and understanding of the singular wholeness of all that is. And secondly understanding to the highest ability the relation and total connection of everything to the all and the all to everything, if dissecting and segregating which is necessity for a surviving ego and being. I find this to be what has been deemed ‘good’.

Evil is the severing of these things. Of all that is. The destruction of the idea of things relating to one another, and more truthfully BEING one another. It is all the same. Evil must destroy. Evil must separate. Good must unite. Good must be love. Evil is entropy. Good is anti-gravity. Evil must evolve. Good must evolve. Life must be. So must death. 
      </p>

The truth can only be felt, it will never be known. The truth is the true currency, all else is a fools dream. At times the evil is the truth, creating a never ending echoing hall of dreams, for those too foolish to recognize the walls of lies they’ve been boxed in by those who know they will never know they taught them to imagine these walls. Sometimes the truth is all good, with so much pity and empathy in heart they will never bring themselves to intervene with these truly lost souls, as the imposition would be too much guilt to bear. 
      </p>

        So it is, the only answer is the self. The ultimate paradox. This is the way. To look inward is to find the all, the ever knowing ever having ever present all. We are all the same. But only you will ever know it.
