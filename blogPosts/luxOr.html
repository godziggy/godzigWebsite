        yes hello it is i.lish. bill. eon. trees. okay. so basically. the older i become the less i know. better. than i used to be. the change you want to see in the world. - helpless. reckless. eshketit. - eye realized something. eye see what eye believe.'yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away'. so they seem. the seam of my pants. very tight! Like eye said, eye see. wonder why i have a kitchen clip pinned to my shirt. like my gas. to the floor. somewhat like a gas station. just like saturn, if you think about it. - anyways. love = lost. the less i know the better. and the less you know the best.
